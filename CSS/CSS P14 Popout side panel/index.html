          DYGL is a band formed in Tokyo, Japan. DYGL (pronounced Day-glo) might
          have begun via a hometown tradition, but it's in this
          cross-continental, wide-reaching approach that they've truly found
          their place. The band released their first EP recorded in the United
          States. As Nobuki Akiyama (Vocalist) said that their first album would
          be the first step for public recognition, they successfully released
          the 1st album in April 2017, which was produced by Albert Hammond Jr.
          With huge support from Albert,DYGL did an Asia tour, a Japan tour and
          did some performances the United Kingdom and United States.
